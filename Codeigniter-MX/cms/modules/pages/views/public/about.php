				<div class="subheading-alt">Blumoo Creative</div>
				<p>According to research, cows are generally very intelligent animals who have amazing memories. Animal behaviorists have even found that cows interact in socially complex ways, actually developing friendships and are extremely loyal to one another.  So here at Blumoo Creative our blue cow logo reminds us to challenge our intelligence by staying on top of industry trends.  Which allows us to continue to perform at the high standards for which we are known. Our blue cow is also a reminder that we should never forget that the client comes first and we are to be loyal to each and everyone we have the privilege to serve.  We know our industry is competitive and we are thankful you have chosen us.</p>

				<p>Google And Facebook Earn More Than The Worldâ€™s Traditional Media Outlets. The ad duopoly (Facebook and Google) tops over $117B in ad revenue, more than every newspaper, magazine, and radio network in the world combined, Inc. reported. The way consumers access news is much different with the rise of search and social media and the numbers reflect this behavior. Case in point, over one-third of millennials and Gen Zers access news through social media platforms.</p>
